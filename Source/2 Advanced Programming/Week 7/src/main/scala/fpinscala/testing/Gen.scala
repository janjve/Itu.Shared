// 1. Introduction
//
// This file contains exercises 2--9
//
// This file is best worked on by reading exercise descriptions in the
// corresponding PDF file.  Then find the place in the file where the stub for
// the exercise is created and complete it.
//
// Before starting to work on the exercises, familiarize yourself with the the
// content already in the file (it has been explained in chapter 8, but it is
// useful to see it all together in one file).
//
// I compile this file using sbt, but in case you need to debug sbt, the
// following should also work (if you put both scala files in the same
// directory):
//
// $ fsc State.scala Gen.scala
//
// Then you can load Exercise2.scala into the REPL to interactively test your
// work. (Exercise2.scala is not so key, it just has all the useful imports in
// the header, that make working with REPL more effcient for these exercises).
// This can be done by issuing "sbt console" and importing the write object from
// Exercise2 (the class will be loaded automatically by sbt).
//
// The file is similar to the one created by Chiusano and Bjarnasson, but it
// has small differences, since I created it myself working through the
// chapter.

package fpinscala.testing
import fpinscala.state._
import fpinscala.state.RNG._

// A generator will use a random number generator RNG in its state, to create
// random instances (but perhaps also some other staff)
case class Gen[A] (sample :State[RNG,A]) {

  // Let's convert generator to streams of generators
  def toStream (seed :Long):Stream[A] =
    Gen.state2stream(this.sample) (RNG.Simple(seed))
  def toStream (rng :RNG):Stream[A] =
    Gen.state2stream(this.sample) (rng)

  // the book uses Stream.unfold, but apparently the standard library lacks this method

  // Exercise 4 (Ex 8.5 second part)
  //
  // Hint: The standard library has the following useful function (List
  // companion object):
  //
  // def fill[A](n: Int)(elem: â‡’ A): List[A]
  //
  // It is of course possible to implement a solution without it, but the
  // result is ugly (you need to replicate the behavior of fill inside
  // listOfN). Then note that State has a method sequence which allows to take
  // a list of automata and execute their transitions as a sequence, feeding
  // the output state of one as an input to the next.  This can be used to
  // execute a series of consecutive generations, passing the RNG state around.

  // def listOfN (n :Int) :Gen[List[A]] = ...



  // Exercise 5 (Ex. 8.6 [Chiusano, Bjarnasson 2015])
  //
  // So this is a solution that is ignoring the nice API that we developed.
  // It builds the result from ground up.

  // def flatMap[B] (f: A => Gen[B]) :Gen[B] = ...


  // It would be convenient to also have map (uncomment once you have unit and flatMap)

  // def map[B] (f : A => B) :Gen[B] = this.flatMap (a => Gen.unit[B] (f(a)))

  // Exercise 6 (Second part of Ex. 8.6)

  // def listOfN(size: Gen[Int]): Gen[List[A]] = ...

  // Exercise 7 (Ex. 8.7; I implemented it as a method, the book asks for a
  // function, the difference is minor; you may want to have both for
  // convenience)
  //
  // Hint: we already have a generator that emulates tossing a coin. Which one
  // is it? Use flatMap with it.

  // def union (that :Gen[A]) :Gen[A] = ...

  // Exercise 8 continues in the bottom of the file (in the companion object)
}

object Gen {

  // A convenience function to convert states (automata) to streams (traces)
  // It would be better to have it in State, but I am not controlling
  // State.scala.

  private  def state2stream[A] (s :State[RNG,A]) (seed :RNG) :Stream[A] =
    s.run(seed) match { case (n,s1) => n #:: state2stream (s) (s1) }

  // A generator for Integer instances

  def anyInteger :Gen[Int] = Gen(State(_.nextInt))

  // Exercise 2 (Ex. 8.4)
  //
  // Hint: Before solving the exercise study the type \lstinline{Gen} in
  // \texttt{Gen.scala}. Then, think how to convert a random integer to a
  // random integer in a range.  Then recall that we are already using
  // generators that are wrapped in \texttt{State} and the state has a
  // \lstinline{map} function.

  // def choose (start :Int, stopExclusive :Int) :Gen[Int] = ...



  // Exercise 3 (Exercise 8.5, part one)
  //
  // Hint: The \lstinline{State} trait already had \lstinline{unit}
  // implemented.

  // def unit[A] (a : =>A) :Gen[A] = ...

  // Hint: How do you convert a random integer number to a random Boolean?
  // Alternatively: do we already have a random generator for booleans? Could
  // we wrap it in.

  // def boolean :Gen[Boolean] = ...


  // Hint: Recall from Exercise1.scala that we already implemented a random
  // number generator for doubles.

  // def double :Gen[Double] = ...



  // (Exercise 4 is found in the Gen class above)

  // Exercise 8 (Ex. 8.8 in Chiusano and Bjarnasson)
  //
  // Hint: Recall that we already have a generator of random double numbers
  // from range (0;1); See Exercise 3. First translate weights to
  // probabilities. Then use our generator of doubles to simulate an unfair
  // coin with flatMap.

  // def weighted[A](g1: (Gen[A],Double), g2: (Gen[A],Double)): Gen[A] = ...
  //
  // Nice test idea for the above: create 1.0:2.0 boolean generator, translate
  // to stream, and try longer and longer prefixes to see if the law of big
  // numbers works
  //
  // (Exercise 9 is found below in class Prop)
