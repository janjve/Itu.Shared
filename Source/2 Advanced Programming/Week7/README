This week we are starting to use sbt (which is a project management tool
similar to maven).  We do not make any serious use of it yes.  We shall use it
more in the coming weeks, but for now we just want to get acquainted with it.

Installing SBT: http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html

Call the following sbt commands to tinker with this project:

sbt compile      - to build the project
sbt console      - to drop into REPL with a suitable classpath setup for your project
sbt clean        - remove sbt generated files

After the console command, the REPL is loaded with a suitably setup CLASSPATH.
So you can for example do:

> import adpro.Exercise85_TestCases._

The REPL will find all the class files (with sbt we shall almost always
compile our scala files, and load the objects into the REPL from class files.
Then we can use the REPL to interact with them and debug stuff.)

The following two targets will become more useful in the future weeks.

sbt test         - to run the scalacheck tests
sbt test:console - drop into REPL with classpath configured for testing classes

IntelliJ people will findout that IntelliJ can somehow import the build.sbt file
to offer the same services (and perhaps they already used them implicitly).  I
do not know about Eclipse unfortunately.

You will find the source files in src/main/scala/* in sbt managed projects.
